Voodoo Bowl is a classic game that robbed countless hours from fellow students and myself in our 7th grade computer science class. This was around the year... Nevermind. 

Suffice it to say that Voodoo Bowl was a Java applet that ran in the browser, and since browsers don't tend to support Java anymore, the game is almost impossible to play. Giving up on getting IE6 to run on my Windows 10 machine after a few hours, I decided my time would probably be better spent simply remaking the game from scratch using JavaScript. While I was at it, it seemed like a good opportunity get a feel for Electron.

The result is not polished, but it was fun to build, and I may come back to it in the future.
